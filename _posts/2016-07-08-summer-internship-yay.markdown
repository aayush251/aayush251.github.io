Working in Dell for summer 
SO MUCH TO LEARNNNN

I can't tell what I'm working on but its something related to AngularJS+SVG implementation.

Did you know?
you can use <ng-include> to include a SVG image with its data!!

for people who don't know SVG = images constructed using code [plus less in size AND extremely customizable)
