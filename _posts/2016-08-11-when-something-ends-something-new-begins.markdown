Will Dell internship ending I'm starting to feel sad :( 
Why? I got to learn so much in just my 2 months here. Most important of all I began to be confident in my code unlike before.
Whats next?
1. Maybe move my blog to tumblr (and be more active)
2. Machine Learning (Nuff said)
3. Starting with new video game project

and to end it off Goodbye Nisekoi.
